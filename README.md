# Hi, I'm Anmol Garg! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here's a bit about me:

- 👀 I'm a passionate MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) developer, with a keen interest in full-stack web development. I enjoy working on both frontend and backend, creating dynamic and scalable web applications.
- 🌱 Currently, I'm expanding my skill set by diving into Android development, primarily using Kotlin and then Java. I'm also learning advanced concepts in ReactJS and exploring Angular for frontend development. 
- 💞️ I'm eager to collaborate on projects that involve building robust web and mobile applications. Whether it’s designing intuitive interfaces with Figma, coding in JavaScript, or deploying apps, I'm excited about tackling new challenges and optimizing performance.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me via email at anmolgarg12203@gmail.com, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/garg-anmol). I'm open to discussing ideas, answering questions, or exploring potential collaborations.

On my GitHub, you'll find repositories showcasing my work with MERN stack technologies, including projects that highlight my skills in creating RESTful APIs, implementing authentication, and deploying applications. I'm also working on Android projects and experimenting with Kotlin, integrating Figma designs, and using tools like Git and GitHub for version control.

I'm passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and creating user-friendly applications. I believe in continuous learning and contributing to the open-source community. 

Feel free to explore my repositories and projects. If you have any questions or ideas, or if you’re interested in collaborating on a project, don’t hesitate to reach out. Let’s build something amazing together! 😄🚀
